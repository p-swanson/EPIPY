Installing Epipy and EPISOL
===========================


.. DANGER::
  You must have the EPISOL kernel downloaded and installed\nIn the future this will be included with pip, however currently you must do a 2-step installation

For installation with PIP run

code:`pip install episol`

epipy is contained within the episol module

code:`from episol import epipy`



Kernel (EPISOL) install instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigate to your directory of choice and create a folder to do installation::

        cd $HOME/
        mkdir episol
        cd episol

Download and extract Fourier transform libraries::

        wget https://github.com/EPISOLrelease/EPISOL/raw/refs/heads/main/src/fftw/fftw-3.3.8.tar.gz
        tar -xzf fftw-3.3.8.tar.gz
        cd fftw-3.3.8/


Configure and make libraries::

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/episol/fftw-3.3.8
        make
        make install


return to your build directory and download and extract the episol kernel::

        cd ../
        wget https://github.com/EPISOLrelease/EPISOL/raw/refs/heads/main/src/kernel/release.tar.gz
        tar -xzf release.tar.gz
        cd release/     

Configure using the path of your installed FFTW libraries and install::

        ./configure --with-fftw=$HOME/episol/fftw-3.3.8
        make
        make install
